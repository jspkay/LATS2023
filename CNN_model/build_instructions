# Cmake
## Needed 
To build with cmake it is necessary to have clang and libopm (openMP library)
Then the CMakeList.txt file has to be modified as follows:
	1. add `SET(CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS "-fno-builtin")` after the line `PROJECT(N2D2_export_C)`
	2. add `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${bin} m)` after `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${bin} N2D2_export_C_Core)`

## Building
execute the following commands
```
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang
$ cmake --build . --target n2d2_test -j 6

# clang
Just execute the command

```$ clang n2d2_test.c src/*.c -Iinclude -lm -std=c99 -g```

This last command can be used fro the debugging
